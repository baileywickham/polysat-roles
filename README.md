# polysat-roles

A discord bot for adding roles to users in polysat. Code is... lacking

## TOTO
There is an issue when a user is typed by name into discord, not tab completed, where the user is not registered as a user object, instead it is a text string of their ID. Need to report this to discord.py or discord
